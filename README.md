## How to Use
Since it's an HTML file, you can modify it with Notepad. Please develop it into your own philosophical map. This is a sample demo and prototype.

## Project Intent
Delay-by-PhiloStruct is not intended to criticize or attack any specific individuals or organizations.

We are different. Because we are different, we discuss, adjust interests, and solve problems. Discussion is a means. When we become exhausted by arguments and the resolution of social structural problems is delayed, it is a loss for the world. Above all, we hope you will use this to reduce your stress.
